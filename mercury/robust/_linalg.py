def lin_combs_in_columns(X, tol=None):
    """
    Returns all the linear combinations that exists among the columns of X by performing Gauss-Jordan elimination.

    Args:
        X (np.array): Any numerical matrix (rank == 2) dimensions (r, c) that is either a numpy ndarray or can be converted into one
                      by passing it to the constructor of a numpy ndarray.
        tol (float):  An optional numerical tolerance. If not used, it will be set according to the number of columns squared times a small
                      constant. Note that numerical rounding errors will inevitably apply after performing reduction operations on the
                      matrix. In that case, deciding if a value is zero, or just very small depends on this tolerance. When you
                      independently compute the rank of X and expect a number of combinations, you can play with this tolerance to match
                      your expectations. Otherwise, it is okay to just leave the default value.

    Returns:
        None, if no linear combinations exist. If linear combinations exist: a matrix of shape (n, c) where n is the number of linear
        combinations found and c is the number of columns of the original X matrix. Each linear combination is defined so the
        **for each row** in the result matrix the product of XÂ·r' is a column of all zeros. r' is the row transposed as a column vector.
